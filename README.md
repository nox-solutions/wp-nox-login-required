# Login Required by NOX for WordPress

Login Required is a WordPress plugin maintained by NOX. The plugin's main goal is to provide a safe way to prevent public access to the WordPress public site. If the visitor access the site, he will be redirected to the WordPress Login Page. Additionally, you can provide an HTML page to present to unauthenticated users.

## REST API

Login Required also applies rules to the WordPress **public** API, but you can choose if you want or not to apply those settings.

## A note on Security

If you choose to redirect all unauthenticated users to the WordPress login, you must remove the default "admin" user, and you are advised to install and configure a Security plugin.
